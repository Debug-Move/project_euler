While most use Project Euler as an opportunity to display optimization and code efficiency skills, I have a different approach.
I want to use this repository as an example of my general coding skills. In my line of work, code clarity is far more important than efficiency. And while efficiency is still a noble goal,
I rather ensure my code is readable and respects the standards set out by myself and those I work with.
Bonus is that I get to brush up on my math skills.

I was inspired by [TheAlgorithms's Project Euler Repo](https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Python/tree/3c887358e59bcfa0c1cc6df840e6781d9a8efac9/project_euler) for formatting and testing.
